**What inspired me to create this app?**

The idea for this app came from a common experience many students face: seeing something wrong but feeling powerless to speak up. Whether it’s bullying, unsafe areas, or other concerns, students often stay silent—not because they don’t care, but because they’re afraid of being judged, ignored, or targeted.

I realized that fear and stigma were major barriers to reporting problems. Many students feel guilty and frustrated. They think - “If there was a way to say something without anyone knowing it was me, I would do it.” -  lot of students feel this way—wanting to speak up but afraid of what might happen. Students needed a way to share what they were seeing and feeling—without risking their safety or reputation. That’s where the inspiration came from: creating a tool that lowers those barriers and gives every student a voice. 

This app is built to protect privacy, encourage honesty, and promote positive change. It’s not just about reporting—it’s about making schools safer, more inclusive, and more responsive to the needs of the people who live and learn there every day.

When students feel heard, they feel empowered. And when schools listen, they grow stronger. This app helps make that connection possible.

**What technical difficulties did I face?**

When I was building my app, I ran into a bunch of technical challenges—especially with making it look good and easy to use. I had to learn HTML and CSS to design the layout and style everything, which was harder than I expected. Sometimes the buttons wouldn’t line up right, or the colors looked weird, and I had to keep testing and fixing things until it felt clean and simple.

Figuring out the user interface was also tricky. I wanted students to be able to report things quickly without getting confused, so I had to think a lot about where to put things and how to make it all clear.

I also started learning Java, which was totally new to me. It took time to understand how the code worked and how to connect everything together. I watched tutorials, read articles, completed coding courses and made a lot of mistakes—but I kept going.

Even though it was tough, I learned a lot about problem-solving and how to make something that actually helps people. It was really cool to see my ideas turn into a real app.
